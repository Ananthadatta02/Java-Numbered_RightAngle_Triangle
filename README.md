# Java-Numbered_RightAngle_Triangle
This Java program generates a right-angled triangle pattern of numbers. The user inputs the triangle size, and the program prints rows where each row starts from 1 and increments up to the row number. It utilizes nested loops: an outer loop for rows and an inner loop for printing numbers.
